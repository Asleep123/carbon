Commands are what the user will use to interact with your bot. They can be anything from simple commands like `ping` to more complex commands like `ban`.

For our bot, let's create a ping command. This command will respond with "Pong!" when the user runs it.

## Creating a Command

To create a command, we need to create a new file in the `commands` folder. Let's call it `ping.js`.

```js
import { Command } from "@buape/carbon"

export default class PingCommand extends Command {
	name = "ping"
	description = "A simple ping command"
	defer = true
	ephemeral = false
}

```

Every component needs to extend one of the `Command` classes. In this case, we are using the regular `Command` class.
The `name` property is the name of the command. This is what the user will use to run the command.
The `description` property is a description of the command. This is what the user will see when they run the help command.
The `defer` property is a boolean that determines whether the command should be deferred or not. If it is set to `true`, the command response will be deferred and show a Thinking... message. If it is set to `false` or not set at all, the command will be replied to immediately.
The `ephemeral` property is a boolean that determines whether the command should be ephemeral or not. If it is set to `true`, the command response will be ephemeral. If it is set to `false` or not set at all, the command response will be visible to everyone.

## Adding a Handler

Now that we have our component, we need to add a handler. This handler will be called when the component is triggered.

Add this code below the constructor, but still within the class you created

```js
	async run(interaction) {
		interaction.reply({ content: "Pong" })
	}
```

This run method will be called when the component is triggered. It gives you an `interaction` object that you can use to see the user who triggered the command, the channel it was triggered in, and more.
